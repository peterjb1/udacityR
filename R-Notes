Lesson 3 - 7/17/2015
========================================================
library(ggthemes)
theme_set(theme_minimal(24))
library(gridExtra)

Learned to create histograms of 1 variable, facet with a second variable to split the data to compare them,
created box plots, and learned how to think about outliers.
Is the outlier an extreme case from bad data or is it good data?
For example:
A significant amount of people have a birthday on January 1 in Facebook,
while every other day on every month show low variance. Is this a coincidence or
  is there another explanation? The default birthday is January 1, so that might explain why.
Then, how do you deal with the outlier in your analysis?

Final: What kind of data do you need to answer the specific question.

Lesson 4 - 7/18/2015
========================================================
Learned bivariate plotting using ggplot and adding layers
to improve understandability of the data.
Also learned about dplyr and alr3.
Example: Used data(Mitchell) to test for correlation.
cor tests for linearity, but Mitchell was cyclical, so need to keep
these things in mind. Try to find the correct pattern.
library(dplyr)

Final: Nature of the data should suggest the graphic, and so features such as scale matter.
